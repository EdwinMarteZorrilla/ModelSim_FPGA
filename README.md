# FPGA Projects

This repository contains a collection of FPGA projects designed to explore and demonstrate foundational concepts in VHDL, particularly focusing on combinational logic. The goal was to create a project that systematically tests and reinforces the basics of VHDL by implementing a randomly designed digital circuit.
**Options:**
* [Option #1:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/tree/main/3.%20Single%20Gates) Using a top-level module that instantiates several individual gates, each defined in separate VHDL files.
* [Option #2:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/3.%20Single%20Gates/opcion2) Creating components and instantiating them within the same VHDL file.
* [Option #3:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/3.%20Single%20Gates/opcion3) Implementing the design in a single VHDL file using a behavioral architecture derived from the logic equation.
* [Option #4:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/3.%20Single%20Gates/opcion4) Implementing the design in a single VHDL file using a behavioral architecture based on a truth table.
* [Led Blink:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/tree/main/5.%20Led_blink) Toggle each 0.5 secs.
