# FPGA Projects

This repository contains a collection of FPGA projects designed to explore and demonstrate foundational concepts in VHDL, particularly focusing on combinational logic (initially). 

The goal was to create a project that systematically tests and reinforces the basics of VHDL by implementing a randomly designed digital circuit.

First, I tried several things, but since I didn't remember everything, I had to reinstall some software and review others. For example, I installed 
[Vivado 2023](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html), [ModelSim](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/750666/modelsim-intel-fpgas-standard-edition-software-version-20-1-1.html), and a text editor I find comfortable to use: [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

**Experiment 1:** The first experiment I conducted was to recreate an example from a previous course to refresh my memory on how to use ModelSim. I used the 2-to-1 multiplexer example ([mux_2x1.vhd](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/1.%20Simple_Test/mux_2x1.vhd)) along with its corresponding testbench ([mux_2x1_tb.vhd](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/1.%20Simple_Test/mux_2x1_tb.vhd)).

**Experiment 2:** This is still a work in progress. Iâ€™ve started developing a communication protocol between the Arduino and the FPGA, allowing the Arduino to relay information from the PC to the FPGA. The main idea is to enable a PC program to send commands that the FPGA can execute. For example, sending the command 01 followed by two data bytes would instruct the FPGA to add the values and return the result. [The relevant files are included](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/tree/main/2.%20FPGA_BasicMath_Shield), but again, this is an ongoing project and not yet complete.

**Experiment 3:** This experiment has multiple parts. I explore how to design a circuit in several ways:
* [3.0:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/simplecircuit.md) Problem Definition/description
* [3.1:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/tree/main/3.%20Single%20Gates) Using a top-level module that instantiates several individual gates, each defined in separate VHDL files.
* [3.2:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/3.%20Single%20Gates/opcion2) Creating components and instantiating them within the same VHDL file.
* [3.3:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/3.%20Single%20Gates/opcion3) Implementing the design in a single VHDL file using a behavioral architecture derived from the logic equation.
* [3.4:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/blob/main/3.%20Single%20Gates/opcion4) Implementing the design in a single VHDL file using a behavioral architecture based on a truth table.

**Experiment 4:** This isn't an experiment per se, but rather a reproduction of Professor Stitt's GitHub tutorial, which can be found [here](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/tree/main/4.%20vhdl-tutorial-UF)  as a reference.



**Options:**

* [Led Blink:](https://github.com/EdwinMarteZorrilla/ModelSim_FPGA/tree/main/5.%20Led_blink) Toggle each 0.5 secs.
