I wanted to create a project that tested most of the basics of VHDL for combinatory logic.
I chose a random circuit like the one below. I made sure I used different logica gates an several input and outputs from the fpga.

 And the correspondent truth table is below.

From there My approach was to implement and simulate the circtuit in different ways to better understand how vhdl files are sturcture.

* Option #1: Using a main module intetiating several indivdual gates / vhdl files.
* Option #2: Creating components and inettianting in the same file
* Option #3: Single file using behavarl structure (table response)
* Option #4: Single file using beahiviral responding to the equiation
